MovieDB
========

MovieDB is an application to complete Udacity course of development for Android. App displays a list of most popular (or top rated) movies by version of www.themoviedb.org site and gives possibility to view some details about film, like Title, Rating, Overview, poster image etc.

### themoviedb.org API Key is required.

In order for the MovieDB app to function properly an API key for themoviedb.org must be included with the build.

I recommend to obtain a key via the [following link](https://www.themoviedb.org/documentation/api), and include the unique key for the build by adding the following line to [USER_HOME]/.gradle/gradle.properties

`MyMovieDbApiKey="<UNIQUE_API_KEY">`
