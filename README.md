MovieDB
========

MovieDB is training application to complete Udacity Android development course. App displays list of most popular (or top rated) films by www.themoviedb.org site's version and give possibility to view some details about film, like Title, Rating, Overview, poster image etc.

### themoviedb.org API Key is required.

In order for the MovieDB app to function properly an API key for themoviedb.org must be included with the build.

I recommend to obtain a key via the [following link](https://www.themoviedb.org/documentation/api), and include the unique key for the build by adding the following line to [USER_HOME]/.gradle/gradle.properties

`MyMovieDbApiKey="<UNIQUE_API_KEY">`
